# Camera M2
A Game Boy redesigned specifically for Game Boy Camera use

[The original Camera M prototype](https://gameboycamera.com/#camera-m), while aesthetically pleasing, did have it's flaws:
* It requires cutting a Game Boy Pocket in half, which I'm having second thoughts on condoning makers willingly destroying perfectly good working Game Boys
* It also relied on the TP4056 charging boards which (while it was far away from the battery), can conduct unneccesary heat & can damage the battery if powered on while charging
* It's design was limited to my skills at that time and can be improved & optimized

This new, improved version will not only address the issues above, but introduce new features for a better user experience.

## This project is still under construction
I am still deciding on the method on distributing this project, but will likely be both a DIY option as well as limited commission builds.

## Updates
**3/1/21** - v0.1 prototype board confirmed to work. Still finalizing shell design, controller board.

## Features
* **All new circuit board**
  * Instead of relying on cutting discontinued circuit boards, the M2 features an all new PCB to transfer your CPU and RAM
  * This not only saves a Game Boy from being destroyed, but lowers limitation on design
* **Smaller, more compact design**
  * Height design limitation is no longer limited to a pre-existing PCB size, allowing for more freedom in shape and size
* **All new buttons**
  * The previous version featured Game Boy SP buttons, M2 features custom buttons for a more camera-like interface
* **Two battery version: one with AA batteries, one with lipo & type-C**
  * Lithim polymer batteries are dangerous, but convenient
  * AA battery option allows for easy swapping if your power runs low
* **Additional features to be revealed later**

## BOM
Coming soon
